# nettipelit-tk-server
Server code for Nettipelit.tk

Hello! This is the source code for my hobby project Nettipelit.tk. This **development** deploy is currently hosted at https://nettipelit-web-example.herokuapp.com/.

## What is thisðŸ¤” ##
This repository is source code for Nettipelit.tk game portal. It loads games from an game portal API and users can play the games at our site without even leaving. The front end of this site has been built on bootstrap-dark-5 css framework. Some sites are generated on back-end and some sites using XMLHttpRequests. 

### How it works ###
Before initializing the app, views.py loads games etc. from the API and stores them at variable called loaded_games.
